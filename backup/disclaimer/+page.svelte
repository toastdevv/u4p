				We are not antisemitic. We have no problem with Jews or Judaism. In fact, we don't even care
				if Jews have a state of their own neither do we give much interest to general Jewish
				politics. What we are against is Israel's theft of land, the occupation, oppression and
				apartheid practiced by Israel, as well as the propaganda shared by Israeli media.
			</li>
			<li>
				Every article written or news shared in our page are backed by sources and evidence. We try
				our best not to leave any gaps for uncertainty or misinformation.
			</li>
			<li>
				Our movement is not specific to Muslims. Anyone is welcome to participate in it. This is a
				human issue.

			<li>
				We do not push hate towards anyone, unless they lack humanity or if they support the
				occupation.
			</li>
			<li>
				We support the Palestinian resistance in all of its forms. However, we do not condone the
				death of any innocent civilians on both sides, just to make sure that is clear. As long as
				resistance leaves civilians out of the equation, we will support it.
